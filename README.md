contemplate on protrusions  
the grand jester  
assault vision accordion  
concertina recording them  
bosses breathing beryllium  
bashing the whole kit and  
caboose dulled by wind  
and the chiming in of  
the news  
after the section has separated  
you'll find your way back to a  
holy miser  
accordance with dictums  
avoiding the consequentialist  
reasoning long enough to  
exit the double digits  
my how you've shown up for me  
wily and prone  
splayed out and straddling  
betwixt the preposterous  
left of me pieces to  
the right of wayfinding  
the basic freedom of mobility  

hello panic,  
my name is unimportant.  
what matters is the flush level  
of the plumb line handed down  
to me across time and generations  
unambiguous signs on the side of  
the feline accompanying  
the wand bearer,  
crowned by agency and sunbeams  
for the occasion  
as we gather photovoltaic  
persuasion  
there's a rift between backstage  
and the orchestral pit in  
my peach  
licked by flames sharp  
and pouring forth  
mist, dew, water falling  
green foam is an option  
a portal  
a stairway to case  
the masonry stage  
a facade and taking  
clear inspiration from the  
boards of tracing  

i'm here to welcome you into the fold  
not to beat out the volume  
so, let's get whisked away  
and prepare for a chamber  
to graduate  
waking moments desiccated  
hydration is trying to stay awake  
and subsist under the basal  
metabolic rate  
subsumed by the push and  
provisions provided by protocol  
particularly pardoned by the patriarch  
of this province  
palm oil plantations be damned  
there's a big discrepancy to be  
accounted for between map   
and territorial war  
of attrition  
before connecting the case to  
kinetic retaliation  
it's difficult to be made  
the determination of  
attribution to actors  
of nation or individual  
super empowerment  

a fowl thing,  
the pond, depicted upon shield  
through thin veil  
the dossier – gossamer  
on the fairest tournament  
a robin on weathervane  
a hooded figure behind  
windowpane  
a strand of unlucky  
composure – nobody bothered  
nobody bettered  
and all wagers final  
till funding dried up  
like the wellspring  
now summer, autumn's here  
under half-moon nearly  
doddering  
teetering  
teething toddler  
approaching the wokest  
dope scholar  
of street pharmacology  
with a prescription for  
sour applesauce  
and survival  

now, this could happen –  
if you listen only to what the  
vulgar basic earthling station  
is depicting  
you might think that  
all this was still undecided  
now of course,  
in the vernacular  
you've been rather willing  
to see parliament  
and until up to now  
these proceedings  
might have gone unrecorded  
but we've been given purpose  
yet again – hallelujah!  
been reborn by the inkwell  
eternally yours, in your quiver  
underneath every unclear  
indiscretion  
tell me about your feelings  
you've gotta  
lot on your mind for a  
feeble philandering philanthropist  
processing...  
chunks of data at a time  
turn around at the drop-off  

point relax these happy notions again  
no retreat these open merry ways  
in my opinion a viewpoint could be  
ascribed to an interloper as easily  
as neural activity drawn on the  
scanning of newspaper wrapped  
fish from yesterday's catch  
on the docks where the mongers  
and sales delight in the sheen  
of glossy eyed daylight seeming  
like more noises could be  
heard before october with no  
delay even if the end wasn't  
obtrusive there's still something  
to say we have to get through  
and i don't care if you don't  
think it's pretty. that's not  
the point. the point is that  
you put it into action what  
you say you're going to do and  
yeah sure it's okay if you  
fail i'm not going to hold it against  
you but i want to see something  
every day that tells me you're  
still beaming at least  

no matter how uncomfortable just with the  
stops unadjusted. a burning to  
take all this liquid and save the  
regards for a vacation later  
the thank you cards this occasion  
appropriate reaction right about  
now is to fold up your card table  
and make way for the oxygen bar  
in light of aurora borealis and  
bulletproof possum playing  
parsimonious  
prove i can fix any problem  
as long as ignorance knows no bottom  
an endless deliverance of  
debaucherous diorama  
a vehicle for the optional  
preference expressed  
via willpower  
truly appreciated later in the  
remembered and still lingering  
dull ache and weariness  
the motivation worn like  
a cloak formidable  
hullabaloo and bullhorn  
bully blown dagger  

listen. there's not much time if we don't make  
it past the next patrol tell my children  
i wish i could have known them  
in this world where we could debate  
the possibility of human connection.  
stop. that's a violation of treaty  
and people before would have had  
something more to say about the  
matter  
well that may be so  
but what makes you certain it's for  
us to bring to slaughter?  
a-hah! you said as much, but who  
knew there was anything more to  
say for the latter?  
climb and stretch  
there's nary a moment to rest  
the refuge of scholars the  
scandal of enemies  
swimming in their own lost  
etymology  
i'll accept any curse that gets  
confirmed by opening this  
passageway to paradise  
denied to mere mortals.  
that's for the sake of  
knowing better and  
discarding the collective  
wisdom of the cohort  

upset the order  
underappreciated by   
the time this reaches the surfacing  
documents will be filled  
in discovery  
i've developed this new posture  
the footing adopted in defiance of  
the financial trust  
and its officers  
not a thing to say for as  
long as bureaucratic  
arrangement engaged  
the affectation of principle  
i'll be one stop shy of  
a full schedule  
skittering along the canyon  
careening  
close to the columns under  
olives and branching to ceiling  
i'm a mirage  
i'm balancing banished  
and bearing the brunt of  
bewilderment  
really a front for the brokering  
of inferior filament
